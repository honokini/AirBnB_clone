AirBnB clone - The console

Description of the project:
The AirBnB console this about create a minishell, this console works in interactive and non-interactive mode; this project is just a basic copy of AirBnB

Description of the command interpreter:
The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

A. How to start it: 
In order to start the console, you must use the following command: ./console.py

B. How to use it:
i.  Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interprete
ii. Store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
iii.Commands: create, show, destroy, all (shows all), update, help, quit

C. Examples:
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
